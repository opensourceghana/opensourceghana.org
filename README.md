# 🌍 Open Source Ghana

**Open Source Ghana** is a community-led initiative dedicated to promoting open collaboration, knowledge sharing, and contribution culture across Ghana’s tech ecosystem.
We believe that open source isn’t just about code — it’s about **community, creativity, and collaboration.**

Our website (**[opensourceghana.org](https://opensourceghana.org)**) is open source and open for everyone to contribute — developers, designers, writers, and enthusiasts alike.

## ✨ Our Mission

To make open source **accessible, inclusive, and exciting** for everyone in Ghana and beyond.
We aim to:

* Encourage **new contributors** to take their first step into open source.
* Partner with **local tech communities** to promote contribution opportunities.
* Showcase **African innovation** through collaborative, transparent projects.
* Build a **welcoming hub** where anyone can learn, share, and grow.
